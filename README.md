# riot + redux



This is a boilerplate/framework for Single Page Applications using RiotJS and Redux. 

Do "npm install" then "node gulp-runner.js".

For dev in VS Code ./build-dev.sh will run gulp and rebuild on changes to client side code. Do this and start server from another console or inside your editor/debugger.
